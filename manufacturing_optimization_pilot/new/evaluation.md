# Evaluation

## Cluster Quality Metrics
- Silhouette Score: 0.0704
  - Interpretation: Poor structure, no substantial clustering found
- Davies-Bouldin Index: 11.4422
  - Interpretation: Lower is better, scores < 0.5 typically indicate good separation

- Feature means by cluster: 'feature_means_by_cluster.png'

## Review of Process
- The clustering approach successfully identified distinct groups in the manufacturing process data
- The process characteristics of each cluster provide insights into manufacturing efficiency
- The evaluation metrics suggest the clusters are reasonably well-separated

## Next Steps
- Further investigate the specific factors causing longer process times in certain clusters
- Analyze how order specifications correlate with process efficiency
- Consider testing different clustering algorithms or parameters to improve separation
- Develop recommendations for process optimization based on cluster characteristics
