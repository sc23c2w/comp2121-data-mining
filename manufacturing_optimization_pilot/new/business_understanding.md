# Business Understanding

## Project Objectives
- Analyze manufacturing process data to identify patterns and inefficiencies
- Discover relationships between order specifications and production times
- Group similar manufacturing processes to optimize resource allocation

## Business Success Criteria
- Identify process clusters that could benefit from optimization
- Determine key factors influencing process duration
- Provide actionable insights for production scheduling

## Data Mining Goals
- Apply clustering algorithms to group similar manufacturing processes
- Identify the most important features that characterize each cluster
- Create visualizations that highlight patterns in the production data

## Project Plan
1. Collect and merge data from multiple sources
2. Clean and transform data for analysis
3. Apply clustering algorithms to identify patterns
4. Evaluate the quality of the clusters
5. Interpret results and provide recommendations
