# Deployment Plan

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Dashboard Implementation**: Develop an interactive dashboard using Dash and Plotly
2. **Integration**: Connect the dashboard to the data pipeline for near real-time updates
3. **User Training**: Provide training sessions to production managers and technicians
4. **Monitoring Setup**: Establish automated monitoring of key metrics and anomalies
5. **Feedback Loop**: Create a mechanism for continuous improvement based on user feedback

## Timeline
- Week 1: Dashboard development and testing
- Week 2: Integration with data sources
- Week 3: User training and pilot deployment
- Week 4: Full deployment and feedback collection

## Resource Requirements
- Server infrastructure for hosting the dashboard
- Database for storing historical and real-time process data
- Development resources for dashboard maintenance
- Training resources for end-users

## Monitoring Mechanisms
- Automated anomaly detection alerts for manufacturing processes
- Weekly reports on process efficiency and bottlenecks
- Monthly review of dashboard effectiveness and usage
- Quarterly review of the entire data mining implementation

## Expected Outcomes
- 15% reduction in manufacturing bottlenecks
- 10% improvement in overall process efficiency
- Enhanced visibility into manufacturing performance
- Data-driven decision-making for process optimization
