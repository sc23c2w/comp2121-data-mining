# Business Understanding

## Project Objectives
- Analyze manufacturing process data to identify patterns and inefficiencies
- Discover relationships between order specifications and production times
- Group similar manufacturing processes to optimize resource allocation
- Identify anomalous processes that cause unexpected delays
- Extract insights from technician reports to correlate human-reported issues with machine inefficiencies

## Business Success Criteria
- Identify process clusters that could benefit from optimization
- Determine key factors influencing process duration
- Detect anomalies that represent bottlenecks in the production pipeline
- Provide actionable insights for production scheduling
- Establish connections between qualitative technician feedback and quantitative process metrics

## Data Mining Goals
- Apply clustering algorithms to group similar manufacturing processes
- Implement anomaly detection to identify unusual process delays
- Perform text analytics on technician reports to extract meaningful patterns
- Identify the most important features that characterize each cluster
- Create visualizations that highlight patterns in the production data

## Project Plan
1. Collect and merge data from multiple sources (including technician reports)
2. Clean and transform data for analysis
3. Apply clustering algorithms to identify patterns
4. Implement Isolation Forest for anomaly detection
5. Analyze technician reports using NLP and ChatGPT
6. Evaluate the quality of the clusters and anomaly detection
7. Interpret results and provide recommendations
8. Deploy an interactive dashboard for continuous monitoring
