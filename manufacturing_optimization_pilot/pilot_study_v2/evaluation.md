# Evaluation
        
                    ## Cluster Quality Metrics
- Silhouette Score: 0.0108
  - Interpretation: No substantial structure
- Davies-Bouldin Index: 9.2571
  - Interpretation: Lower is better, scores < 0.5 typically indicate good separation

## Anomaly Detection Evaluation
- Total anomalies detected: 152 (5.01% of all processes)
- Average anomaly score: -0.0833

## Comparison with Real-World Performance
- Normal processes average duration: 7.77 minutes
- Anomalous processes average duration: 9.45 minutes
- Anomalies are 21.65% longer than normal processes

### Process Duration by Cluster
- Cluster 0: Average 6.47 minutes (Min: 2.00, Max: 15.00)
- Cluster 1: Average 6.67 minutes (Min: 2.00, Max: 15.00)
- Cluster 2: Average 11.26 minutes (Min: 2.00, Max: 22.00)
