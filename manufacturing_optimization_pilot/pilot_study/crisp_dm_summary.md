# Manufacturing Process Analysis using CRISP-DM

## Project Overview
This project applies the CRISP-DM methodology to analyze manufacturing process data. The goal is to identify patterns in production processes, discover inefficiencies, and provide actionable insights for optimization.

## CRISP-DM Phases

### 1. Business Understanding
- Defined project objectives: identify patterns and inefficiencies in manufacturing processes
- Established business success criteria: discover process clusters for optimization
- Set data mining goals: apply clustering to group similar processes

### 2. Data Understanding
- Explored data from multiple sources: order history, production history, equipment inventory
- Identified key variables: process duration, order specifications, equipment requirements
- Discovered initial insights on process time distribution

### 3. Data Preparation
- Merged data from multiple sources
- Calculated process duration from start and end times
- Removed unnecessary columns
- Handled missing values

### 4. Modeling
- Selected K-means clustering algorithm
- Configured for 3 clusters
- Applied model to the prepared data
- Assigned cluster labels to each process instance

### 5. Evaluation
- Assessed cluster quality using silhouette score and Davies-Bouldin index
- Characterized each cluster by dominant processes and distinctive features
- Identified business insights related to process efficiency
- Created visualizations to illustrate cluster separation

### 6. Deployment
- Developed plan for sharing findings with production management
- Outlined strategy for ongoing monitoring
- Identified areas for future improvement
